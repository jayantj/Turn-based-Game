The game is a turn-based strategy board game in which the objective is to capture the enemy flag by moving an allied unit onto the flag.

The identity of the enemy units is hidden by default. The enemy flag is hidden completely from your view. These can be revealed by using your scout's 
special ability.

You have control of various different units. They all can attack, move and use a special ability. The special ability triggers a cooldown during which the unit cannot be used at all.
